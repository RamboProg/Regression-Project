# Simple Machine Learning Project

This is a simple machine learning project that demonstrates how to implement both linear and polynomial regression models using Jupyter Notebook.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.1.1
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Import the required packages

## Usage

1. Open the `MLProject.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells in the notebook to see how the models are implemented.
3. Modify the code to suit your needs.

## Linear Regression Model

The linear regression model is implemented using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` class. The model is trained on a dataset of house prices and square footage.

## Polynomial Regression Model

The polynomial regression model is implemented using scikit-learn's `PolynomialFeatures` class and `LinearRegression` class. The model is trained on a dataset of car prices and mileage.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to implement both linear and polynomial regression models using Jupyter Notebook. You can use this project as a starting point for your own machine learning projects.
